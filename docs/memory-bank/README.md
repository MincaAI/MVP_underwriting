# Cline Memory Bank

This folder serves as the persistent "memory bank" for Cline, the AI coding assistant. It is designed to store and organize key project knowledge, context, and important notes for rapid recall and onboarding.

## 📚 Purpose

- **Knowledge Persistence:** Maintain important project context across sessions.
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Instantly get up to speed by reading all memory bank files.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Improve decision-making by referencing project history and conventions.

## 🧠 Usage

- **To refresh Cline's memory:**  
  Type `get ready` and Cline will:
  1. Read all `docs/memory-bank/*.md` files
  2. Scan key documentation in the main `docs/` folder

  Add or update `.md` files in this folder with important architecture, service, database, or development notes.
